    <h1>Tame Impala</h1>

    <h2>Who Are Tame Impala?</h2>
    
<p>Tame Impala is the psychedelic music project of Australian multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker.
<br>In the recording studio, Parker writes, records, performs, and produces all of the project's music.
<br>As a touring act, Tame Impala consists of Parker (guitar, vocals), Dominic Simper (guitar, synthesiser), Jay Watson (synthesiser, vocals, guitar), Cam Avery (bass guitar, vocals), and Julien Barbagallo (drums, vocals).
<br>The group has a close affiliation with fellow Australian psychedelic rock band Pond, sharing members and collaborators, including Nick Allbrook, formerly a live member of Tame Impala.
<br>Originally signed to Modular Recordings, Tame Impala is now signed to Interscope Records in the US, and Fiction Records in the UK.</p>

<h3>Influences</h3>

<p>Electronic music is a big influence.
<br>Parker has used rock instrumentation in an electronic manner, sayin
<br>"The way we do music, it's organic, but it's meant to be quite repetitive and hypnotic, almost in a kind of electronic nature.
<br>Using our playing as though it was a living sample".
<br>A heavy feature on Innerspeaker is a pitch-shifted guitar tone that many mistook for a synth.
<br>Parker mentioned this by saying "I had a few obsessions when recording Innerspeaker.
<br>One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples and pretty much anything except guitars and drums.
<br>I'm obsessed with confusing people as to the origin of a sound."</p>

<h3>Fun Facts</h3>

<p>Tame Impala have been around for a while, Since 2010, to be exact.
<br>With four albums under their belt you could probably call Tame Impala veterans at this point.
<br>Their 2012 release, Lonerism, earned them a Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Music Album.
<br>Among their other accolades are the ARIA Awards for Best Rock Album and Album of the Year they took home for both Lonerism and their third album, Currents.
<br>Frontman Kevin Parker also won the APRA Award for Song of the Year in 2016 thanks to Currents‘ opening track, “Let It Happen“.
<br>Rihanna's “Same Ol’ Mistakes,” was a take on “New Person, Same Old Mistakes” from Tame Impala's 2015 album, Currents.</p>
